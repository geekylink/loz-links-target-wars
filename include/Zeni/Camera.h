 * \brief Camera / Point of View
 *
 * This class describes a viewpoint for a scene.  Its use is similar in 
 * concept to that of an actual camera.  You take time to position a 
 * camera before you shoot (render) a scene.
 *
 * \note Tell the rendering engine to use a camera with a call to Video::get_reference().set_3d(...);
