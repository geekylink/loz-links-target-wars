 * \ingroup Zenilib
 *
 * \brief A Font database read in from a file.
 *
 * One can retrieve fonts by name from this singleton class.
 *
 * \note It is important to note that Fonts can potentially take up a lot of memory.  While it is still desirable to name fonts by use rather than actual font name, it may be necessary to reload different font databases to keep memory usage down.
