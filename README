1. Introduction
===============

The Zenipex Library is a game development framework, created 
with the goal of allowing someone with some knowledge of C++ 
to create 3D games for both Windows and Linux platforms (and 
hopefully others) quickly.

The original focuses of the project were to abstract away 
some basic differences between OpenGL and Direct3D 9 and to 
create an object-oriented framework for game development.  
It was never the goal to abstract away all differences 
between OpenGL and Direct3D or to create a fully optimzed 
game development library with every feature you could 
possibly want.

Truly it started as an exercise in learning both OpenGL and 
Direct3D, with the hope that it would become something 
useful to me if to nobody else.  Hopefully someone else in 
Wolverine Soft will use the thing too ;)

Since its initial release, ease of use has been a continual 
focus.  Features have been added, and performance has been 
generally improved as well.

2. License/Authors
==================

The Zenipex Library is an open source  project.  For 
details please refer to the first comment in any given file 
and refer to the ./COPYING and ./GPL files.

The Runtime GPL allows the use of macros, templates, and
static linkage without the requirement that your code be
GPL'd should you choose to release your binaries into the
wild.  You are free to keep your code closed source, 
though I encourage you to keep it open if you are not 
obliged to keep it closed.

Keep in mind that to fully comply with the GPL, you must 
include a copy of the GPL with your your releases using the 
Zenipex Library.  Additionally, you should state what parts 
of your release are bound by the GPL.  Finally, you must 
meet one of the following conditions.

 1) A copy of the GPL'd source code is included.

 2) A written offer to provide the GPL'd source code is 
    included, and you keep an archive of all GPL'd source 
    code ready at all times.

In my opinion, the first option is easier, as it requires 
no effort post-release.  Additionally, in the second case, 
you must be willing to provide the source to anyone who 
asks -- not just the people who download your library.

If you have any questions about the GPL, feel free to shoot 
me an e-mail.
